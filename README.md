Based on Java sockets, Http Server is started on configured port. It handles each client in separate thread.  

There is framework library added. It parses plain HTTP request from CURL.
Code needs to be cleaned. This would be a continous process as things become more clear with passage of time.

Currently there are some empty classes provided. They will be functional later. 


Features:
- Routes are based on ScalaRoute.
- Views are loading with passed params
- Request/Response objects are functional. We can see each one's functionality in their respective classes.
